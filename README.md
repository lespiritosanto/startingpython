My beginner programs

This repository will be used to create and share my learning process of the Python language. 
I will post my exercises and from time to time try to upgrade them with the new concepts that I learn. 
They will be initially mixed with some words in Portuguese (like variable names and some commentaries), but I will update them all to English later.
Please, any considerations about the programs will be welcome!
